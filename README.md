# Dear Diary,

Learning new programming language is a routine that requires patience and everyday progress. I'm sharing my everyday progress with you to make sure I'm not stagnating and leaving this activity at the beggining of journey.

## Day 1.

Earlier I started learning `Go In Practice` and even finished with the first chapter, but then left this book waiting for me for better times. The time has come and I blown dust off a book today and finished reading the second chapter. It covered flags, commands, configurations and some example of working with a simple web server. That was pretty interested, but I noticed that I lacked information about types, scopes and syntax overall. So I spent 2 minutes in Twitter to find some neat courses and chosen have chosen [Ednsquare | Learn Go](https://ednsquare.com/story/learn-go-beginners-guide-to-learn-golang-from-scratch-------gTmFx6) as a starting point. Read an introduction, then tried an example from the book, just typed and checked it. That's weird sometimes, but at least I noticed things I need to clarify.

## Day 2.

I decided to continue with `Learn Go` course first and cover `Variables, Types and Scopes` part. Everything is clear and rarely there are common things with JS. This is good, this is why I'm here, to notice as much differences as I can.

More I read `Go In Practice`, more I see that this is not a book for total newcomers in the language. Well, OK. Not a problem. There is no need to set a goal and understand absolutely everything. Today's chapter, `Parallel Calculations` explained an interesting concept of `Mutex`, which allows to lock/unlock structures (to avoid simultaneous access if prohibided). Continuing this topic, it was great to read about a concept of Channels (with their weird new syntax, `<-`). Going to try couple of examples with those mechanisms later today.
